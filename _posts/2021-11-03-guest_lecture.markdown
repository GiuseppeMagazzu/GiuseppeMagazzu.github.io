description: Guest Lecture on Multi-Omic data integration - A Case Study
---
Last week I was asked by a friend to give a guest lecture to some students attending courses in Mathematics and Computer Science. The students had no knowledge 
regarding machine and deep learning, nor regarding computational and systems biology. I was explicitly told not to make things too complicated ðŸ˜…, which is why in 
the lecture I focused on concepts rather than mathematical aspects and methods.

Here's the video of the lecture:

Do you have any questions regarding what I explained, or want to know more? Please look at [my published paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/20/3546/6273576?guestAccessKey=dc06aa0a-7106-4846-8fa9-ad69b68279e4) (and cite me! ðŸ˜‰).
