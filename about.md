<p>I love studying complex, real phenomena with the help of data. I am interested 
in solving actual problems to improve the world in which we live. I also 
love chess, politics and whatever part of human knowledge I manage to understand ðŸ˜‰. </p>

<p>Being Sicilian, I can definitely say that my background contributed to my being skeptic towards 
any non-evidence-based "revolutionary" discovery/technology.</p>

<p>Lived in Italy, California and currently based in England.</p>
