<p>I love studying complex, real phenomena with the help of data. I am interested 
in solving actual problems to improve the world in which we live our life. I also 
love chess, politics and whatever part of human knowledge I manage to understand :wink:.</p>

<p>Sicilian, definitely my background contributed to my being skeptic towards 
any no-evidence-based "revolutionary discovery/techonology".</p>

<p>Lived in Italy and currently based in England.</p>
